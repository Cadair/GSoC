<p>coala has two mentors for every project:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Primary mentor</strong>: responsible for the administrative tasks of the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary mentor</strong>: has little to no responsibility, but provides backup
and code review for aspects of the project which are relevant to their
expertise.</li>
</ol>

<p>We expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be active on <a href="https://coala.io/chat">gitter</a>.</li>
  <li>Blog at least once per milestone (this will be aggregated on
<a href="https://blog.coala.io">blog.coala.io</a>).
Participate in weekly meetings with your student.</li>
  <li>Review your students pull requests timely.</li>
  <li>Get in contact with the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in mentoring, please contact one of the admins
indicating the reason your open source project is suitable to be included as
a project to be mentored under the coala administrative umbrella.</p>

<p>List of admins is <a href="http://projects.coala.io/#/mentors">here</a>.</p>
