question: "What are my obligations as a student during the GSoC?"
---
We expect you to:

* Be active on matrix, specifically in [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/!WZbLERcNJxrvkxPfyV:matrix.org?via=sw1v.org&via=matrix.org&via=thebeckmeyers.xyz).
* Blog at least once per week.
* Participate in regular meetings with your mentor.
* Review PRs of other students and contributors. This is a big part of open
source work and we'll make sure to help you get started.
* All code you want to merge has to have full test coverage and documentation.
* If anything, for whatever reason, looks
to be problematic, talk to your mentor or an admin!

And Again:
__Get in contact with your mentors or the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise!__
