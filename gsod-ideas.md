# Google Season of Docs Ideas

* The Matrix Spec (https://matrix.org/docs/spec) is currently generated onto a single page per specification, and doesn't look good. Improve the layout of these pages by taking inspiration from the API documentation of other projects, and from tools such as Slate (https://github.com/lord/slate)
* Update the Matrix specification documentation to contain more inline examples of usage of the various endpoints. For example, almost all endpoints are adequately described, but an improvement could be to add greater context to each section.
* The Matrix Spec is a rapidly evolving living document. Work with the team to ensure that the Spec is up to date.
* Create a series of documents which are "top-down" rather than "bottom-up". For example, take a real-world use case and write a tutorial or article explaining how Matrix would be used in solving it.
